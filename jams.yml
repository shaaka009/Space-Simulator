  Our project is an interactive solar system physics simulator. Users can
  choose from a series of ready-to-go scenes, or choose to create their
  own in the command line. The system supports custom size, mass, color, names,
  positions, and velocities. When you are ready to go, play out your simulation
  with physically accurate gravity and collisions. Users can control the speed
  of the simulation and the tilt angle of the orbital plane. They can pause,
  play, and restart the scene. You can even click on bodies to get live
  statistics on a bodies velocity, position, name, etc. Set the scene and watch
  Newtonian accurate gravitational physics unfold!
